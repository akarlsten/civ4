# Civilization 4 Intro Screen Tribute

![](./civ4.png)

As a teenager I used to spend what felt like hours staring at the Civilization 4 intro screen. Both because of the great Baba Yetu by Christopher Tin (first video game music to ever win a Grammy, btw), but also the mesmerizing animation of the revolving Earth with the rising sun and the city lights coming on at night.
